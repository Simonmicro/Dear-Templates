summary: Improve Linux sound quality to the absolute (quality) maximum

# Install #
_Make sure to also install the "recommends" - otherwise no plugin would be available..._
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mikhailnov/pulseeffects
sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseeffects --install-recommends
```
...reboot now (the best way to reload the whole audio server)...

## Enjoy ##
Open up `PulseEffects` and configure all the global settings you need. You can also enhance your audio input that way! Very nice.
