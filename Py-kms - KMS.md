[Go here](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms) for the server. I really recommend the Docker variant!

[Go here (windows)](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms/wiki/Windows-GVLK-Keys) or [Go here (office)](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms/wiki/Office-GVLK-Keys) for the keys.

[Go here](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms/wiki/Manual#slmgr-and-ospp-commands) for the (relevant part) of the handbook regarding the activation procedure.
