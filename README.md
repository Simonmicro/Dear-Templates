This is a collection of little guides about servers, problems and features - mostly Linux.
You can view and learn from them - they are designed to give a quick and dirty overview about a topic.
Sometimes they also include notes to workarounds or tips and tricks!
What ever you intend to do with them, have fun and make sure to share this repo, if it helped you!

## Contributing ##
You found a bug or want to improve something? Just do it!

_But please make sure to also update the `summary:`-tag at the head of the modified file..._

### What is that header at top of every file? ###
This markdown files are written for my website - compiled by hugo. And because I want to specify an own summary,
I'll need to provide a own header in each file, therefore a simple Python script is generating the rest - so there is not too much overhead here...

## Redistribution ##
Hmmm, yes you can also include this files into e.g. your own hugo website as e.g. git submodule. But please give credit to all the contributors here.

# TODOs #
